        <p>Hello, I am a junior full stack developer from Helsinki and I came to this field from civil aviation.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I am originally from Russia and have come a long way here.

          I am originally from Russia and have come a long way here. 
          When I studied at a Civil aviation university I realized that I am interested in programming and started dedicating my time to learning it. Also I realized that I want to have more freedom and opportunities to grow which that country couldn’t give me and since IT specialists are in demand all around the globe I decided to switch the field of study and enter Bauman Moscow State university to learn programming. During the program I started searching different countries to move to and choose Finland. Initially I didn’t have money to afford to move here and I decided to apply to a university in Estonia in order to move here from there.
          In order to enter the university in Estonia I needed to pass IELTS exam and even though I hadn’t known any English before, I spent few months actively learning the language and made the thing that had seemed to be impossible- got B2 level in just a few months.
          <br/>
          After I have successfully passed the IELTS exam I entered the university where I studied software engineering and entrepreneurship.
          <br/>
          And with this long journey behind I’m finally here.
